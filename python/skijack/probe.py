"""Behavioral decoding: read a compiled term by running it, never by
reading combinator syntax.

This is the verification discipline of the paper's artifact
(``SURFACE-LANGUAGE-DESIGN.md`` §1, last bullet): a value is observed by
applying the term to fresh uninterpreted marker atoms and seeing which
one comes back.  The markers are host-level constants admitted in the
harness and nowhere in the language (``SYNTAX.md`` §8).

:func:`fast_reduce` is the artifact's reducer wrapper (``tower_harness.py``
and ``scry_harness.py`` build the same one on top of
``aviary_kernel.reduce``): ``reduce()`` with the size guard sampled every
``SIZE_CHECK_EVERY`` contractions instead of on every one.  Nothing here
reimplements contraction or bracket abstraction.
