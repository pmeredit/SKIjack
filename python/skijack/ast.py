"""The lexicon-free syntax tree.

A program's identity is its tree (``SYNTAX.md`` §5): there is no lexicon
field anywhere below, so a tree parsed from the ASCII spelling and a tree
parsed from the Unicode spelling of the same program are equal objects.

Every node is a frozen dataclass over tuples, so trees are hashable and
compare structurally.
