"""The dictionary: Tier 1's table, and lift.

``DESIDERATA.md`` §5 -- "the dictionary is the ABI's public face. Tier
1's table, with expansions, sizes, and hashes, is a versioned artifact,
published with the language, and it is the same table the runtime's jets
key on."  ``RUNTIME-DESIGN.md`` §2 says how the runtime uses it: it
"matches expanded subterms against a table of known combinators by
structural hash".

And item 8 -- "a term produced by the expander can be lifted back to
named source by exact structural matching against the dictionary of
known expansions, and only that; unknown subterms stay raw."  That is
:func:`lift`, and :func:`lower` takes it back.

**The hash** is a Merkle hash over the tree, prefixed with the table's
version: ``skijack-1:8f3c…``.  A leaf hashes its name; an application
hashes ``"(" + hash(fn) + " " + hash(arg) + ")"``; both are ``sha256``
truncated to 16 hex digits.

Two reasons for Merkle rather than hashing a printed form.  It is
computable in one bottom-up pass and *incrementally*: a runtime that
hash-conses its nodes already has every child's hash when it builds a
parent, which is exactly how ``RUNTIME-DESIGN.md`` §2's jet table is
meant to match ("matches expanded subterms against a table of known
combinators by structural hash").  And it is over the *tree*, not the
DAG, so two structurally equal terms hash alike however they were
shared -- the runtime meets a term without knowing how it was built.
:func:`canonical` gives the fully parenthesized printed form, which
determines the same tree and is what the tests read.

Changing an entry changes its hash, and ``DESIDERATA.md`` §5 makes that
a version change.

**Lift is not reduction.** It renames exact structural matches, largest
first, and nothing else; ``lower(lift(t)) == t`` holds by construction
and is tested on every corpus term.
